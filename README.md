hello listener I am shakil from bd. This simple application have the following features,

I had use firebase authentication service so that an unauthorized person are not seeing all the services.
In the mongodb server all data are inserted there.
I use access token for more application security.
Also use tailwind css for styles and responsive features.
To dynamic routes I used the react router for better UI experinces.
This is all for today, have a nice day!
